## Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Handwriting Synthesis Program

## Overview:

The goal is to create a handwriting synthesis program that can take thousands of letters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) all in SVG format and create different versions of handwriting that vary in style. The program will utilize existing SVGs to generate unique and distinguishable handwriting styles.

## Repository:

pywritesmooth

## Key Components:

### LSTM Handwriting Model Training:

**Class:** LSTMTrainer

**Description:** This class is responsible for training the LSTM model using the provided SVG letter data. It preprocesses the data, constructs the LSTM architecture, and trains the model using the training data.

### Handwriting Style Variation:

**Class:** StyleVariator

**Description:** This class takes the trained LSTM model and applies variations to the generated handwriting styles. It can adjust parameters such as stroke thickness, slant, curvature, and spacing to create different styles of handwriting.

### SVG Letter Data Processing:

**Class:** SVGProcessor

**Description:** This class handles the processing of SVG letter data. It reads the SVG files, extracts the necessary information such as stroke paths and coordinates, and converts them into a format suitable for training the LSTM model.

### Handwriting Synthesis:

**Class:** HandwritingSynthesizer

**Description:** This class brings together the LSTM model, style variation, and SVG data processing to synthesize handwriting. It takes input text and generates handwriting in the specified style by utilizing the trained LSTM model and applying style variations.

### User Interface:

**Library:** PyQt

**Description:** The user interface will be developed using the PyQt library. It will provide a user-friendly interface for inputting text, selecting handwriting styles, and displaying the synthesized handwriting.

## Conclusion:

The Handwriting Synthesis Program aims to create a versatile and customizable tool for generating handwriting in various styles. By utilizing SVG letter data, LSTM model training, and style variation techniques, the program will be able to produce unique and realistic handwriting output. The user interface will enhance the user experience by providing an intuitive interface for interacting with the program.
